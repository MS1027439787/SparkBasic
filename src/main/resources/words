To see a world in a grain of sand
And a heaven in a wild flower
Hold infinity in the palm of your hand
And eternity in an hour
If you were a teardrop;In my eye
For fear of losing youI would never cry
And if the golden sunShould cease to shine its light
Just one smile from youWould make my whole world bright
Never give up
Never lose hope
Always have faith
It allows you to cope
Trying times will pass
As they always do
Just have patience
Your dreams will come true
So put on a smile
You'll live through your pain
Know it will pass
And strength you will gain

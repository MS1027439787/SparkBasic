To see a world in a grain of sand,
And a heaven in a wild flower,
Hold infinity in the palm of your hand,
And eternity in an hour.
If you were a teardrop;In my eye,
For fear of losing you,I would never cry.
And if the golden sun,Should cease to shine its light,
Just one smile from you,Would make my whole world bright.
Never give up,
Never lose hope.
Always have faith,
It allows you to cope.
Trying times will pass,
As they always do.
Just have patience,
Your dreams will come true.
So put on a smile,
You'll live through your pain.
Know it will pass,
And strength you will gain
